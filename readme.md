> Walk ESTree nodes simple and fast

```js
// Walk tree with a visitor
walk(source, {
  ReturnStatement: function (node, stop) {
    // You can call `stop` to exit the walking
  }
})

// Walk tree with a fast alrenative:
for (var q = [source], node; node = q.pop(); walk.step(node, q)) {
  switch (node.type) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Functions for walking [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) nodes.  Like others, it attempts to stay future-proof by enumerating the node's keys instead of handling the node's type, while also providing simple usage.

## Installation

```sh
npm i estree-walk
```

## Usage

There is two methods of walking trees with this library:

 1. Using a visitor pattern with `walk(node, visitor)`
 2. Using a looping pattern with `walk.step(node, queue)`

### `walk(node, visitor)`

Walks a node tree using a visitor.  A visitor can be a function that executes for all nodes, or an object of functions that execute for a given node type.  Visitor functions have the signature `(node, stop?)`, where `stop` can be called to exit quickly.

```js
// Visit by node type
walk(node, {
  FunctionDeclaration: function (node) {
    console.log(node.id)
  },

  ImportDeclaration: function (node, stop) {
    if (isRelative(node.source.value)) {
      // Exit walking quickly with stop
      stop()
    }
  }
})

// Visit all nodes
walk(node, function (node) {
  console.log(node.type, node.loc)
})
```

### `walk.step(node, queue)`

An alternative to the visitor pattern is using a loop, which can provide a much faster way to walk trees, but at the price of extra maintence.  The `step` function simply scans `node` for possible child nodes, and pushes them onto `queue`.  This can be used with a loop to walk the tree:

```js
// Start loop with a source node:
for (var queue = [mainNode]; queue.length;) {
  var node = queue.pop()
  // handle `node` with a switch statement or whatever
  // then continue walking using step function:
  walk.step(node, queue)
}
```

This method is _much_ faster than a visitor pattern at the cost of less understandable code (as it is used internally to create the visitors).  The visitor pattern is likely fast enough for most cases where it is preferred over this.
